# Laptop-Price-Predictor

This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features and specifications. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a laptop given its characteristics.

**Project Overview**
With the rapid advancements in technology, laptops come in a wide range of configurations and prices. As a result, consumers often face challenges in understanding the factors influencing laptop prices and making informed purchasing decisions. This project addresses this issue by building a predictive model that takes into account various attributes of laptops and predicts their prices.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project contains information about laptops, including features such as processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, display size, graphics card, and more. The dataset is collected from various sources and curated to ensure accuracy and relevance for price prediction.

**Methodology**
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for model training.

**Feature Engineering:** We perform feature engineering to extract relevant information from the dataset and create new features that may improve the predictive performance of the model.

**Model Selection:** Several machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, are evaluated for their performance in predicting laptop prices. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

**Model Training and Evaluation:** The selected model is trained on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated using cross-validation techniques to assess its generalization performance. Hyperparameter tuning may be applied to optimize the model's performance further.

**Deployment:** Once the model is trained and validated, it can be deployed as a web application, API, or integrated into other systems for real-time laptop price prediction.
